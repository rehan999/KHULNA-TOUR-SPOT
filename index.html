            <p>The Sundarban Mangrove forest is big the forest of Bangladesh. It covers an area of approximately
                5900 sq. km. The name may have been derived from the Sundari trees that are found in Sundarbans in
                large numbers. Honey and wax are
                in plenty and skins of pythons and reptiles are sought after. The forest is the abode of the Royal
                Bengal Tiger. The paper describes the nature and species composition of the forest, its physical and
                climatic aspects, economic and ecological importance to the people of Bangladesh.

            <h1 class="color">KHAN JAHAN ALI BRIDGE</h1>
            <P>The issue of construction a bridge over the river Rupsha to connect Khulna city with hinterland of Mongla
                Sea-port and other parts of the Southern region was a long-standing demand of the people of the area.
                Now that dream comes to reality. After the construction of Khan Jahan Ali Bridge and the bypass road,
                the city is being expanded and as a consequence the living standard of the people of the surrounding
                areas is being changed. A comparison between past and present situation of peoples’ income influencing
                household-ownership pattern is presented in this paper though an econometric model.</P>
